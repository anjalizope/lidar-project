Programs for parsing binary files and mapping LIDAR data from LIDAR Drone project with USC

In summer 2020, I worked with doctoral canditates at USC to build a LIDAR-enabled drone for geological search at the Department of Earth Sciences. Our Livox LIDAR sensor did not come with built in support for visualizing or parsing binary LIDAR data that was generated from the sensor, or directly receiving the coordinate data as a dataset. I developed a Binary File Reader for Livox LIDAR sensors that parses binary files generated by the sensor into coordinate data that can be downloaded, analyzed and visualized. 

Contributed BinaryFileReader.py to OpenPyLivox repository (open source LIDAR mapping repo) in Sept. 2020
